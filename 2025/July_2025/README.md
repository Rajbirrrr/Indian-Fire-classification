# AICTE Internship Cycle 2 - July 2025

### Project Description

This internship project focuses on three distinct but interrelated machine learning applications:

1. **Fire Classification using MODIS Data**: The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can classify fire events by analyzing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data. The model will identify and categorize wildfire occurrences, enabling better monitoring and management of fire-related events across different regions.
